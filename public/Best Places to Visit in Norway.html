<h1>Best Places to Visit in Norway!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 places of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Oslo Opera House</h3>
<p>This is a beautiful place which houses the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet. Opera, music, and ballet performances all perform in this Opera house.</p>
<h3>Munch Museum</h3>
<p>A really cool museum which is built to dedicate and exhibit Edvard Munch's life and art. At Munch, you can find 'The Scream' in three different versions, illustrating Munch's conceptualisation on different surfaces.</p>
<h3>Sognsvann Lake</h3>
<p>A beautiful lake that is located in the west of Oslo. During winter, you can build campfires and enjoy grilling meat whilst watching the magical landscapes which unfolds around you. If you are lucky, you may even get a glimpse of the northern lights! </p>
