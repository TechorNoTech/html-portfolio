<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a determined individual who constantly seeks opportunities to learn about the world better.
  I am a final-year student at Nanyang Technological University majoring in History. 
  As a curious individual interested in broadening my perspectives about the world, I jumped at the chance to switch from my engineering diploma to History.
  Albeit a massive switch from STEM to a non-STEM major, the intricacies of learning history have vastly improved my critical analytical and communication skills.
  
</p>

<p>History majors must write intensively, analyse historical events, and posit arguments based on justified evidence. 
  As such, writing and communication skills are essential skillsets I have developed at University. 
  I also put what I have learned from my technical and analytical knowledge into use in my internships as an HR/Finance intern at Essilor Singapore and a trade intern at MTI Singapore, respectively.
</p>

<p>Recently, my interest in the technology sector has also propelled me to learn about cloud technology and Javascript, and I have since attained my AWS cloud practitioner certificate in November 2023.
  As a budding tech enthusiast, I am interested in learning and implementing tech to solve business problems.
  I aspire to be a cloud architect who can architect cloud solutions for businesses and improve their cloud computing strategies. 
</p>

<p> My hobbies include learning languages and climbing. My love for languages, for instance, saw me take up popular languages like Korean and German, allowing me to learn more about the different languages and cultures in different countries. 
 As a result of understanding the nuances of different cultures, I could appreciate practised customs and traditions while on overseas exchange in Korea and Norway.
 Climbing as a leisure sport has helped me instil grit and resilience. It has also allowed me to meet friends from different career paths.
 Overall, I appreciate the abundance in life and enjoy meeting and connecting with people from all walks of life.
